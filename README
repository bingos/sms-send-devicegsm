            _port     => '/dev/ttyS1',
            );
      
  # Send a message to ourself
      my $sent = $sender->send_sms(

DESCRIPTION
    SMS::Send::DeviceGsm is an SMS::Send driver that uses Device::Gsm to
    deliver messages via attached hardware.

    You provide the hardware port and the baudrate to use. Consult
    Device::Gsm for further information on what devices and baudrates are
    supported.

  Disclaimer
    The authors of this driver take no responsibility for any costs accrued
    on your phone bill by using this module.

    Using this driver will cost you money. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED

METHODS
  new
      # Create a new sender using this driver
      my $sender = SMS::Send->new( 'DeviceGsm',
            _baudrate => '19200', 
            _port     => '/dev/ttyS1',
            );

    The "new" constructor takes two parameters, which should be passed
    through from the SMS::Send constructor.

    The params are driver-specific for now, until SMS::Send adds a standard
    set of params for specifying the login and password.

    _baudrate
        The "_baudrate" param defaults to '19200'.

    _port
        The "_port" param is the serial port to connect to. On Unix, can be
        also a convenient link as /dev/modem (the default value). For Win32,
        COM1,2,3,4 can be used.

    Returns a new "SMS::Send::DeviceGsm" object, or dies on error.

  send_sms
      # Send a message to a particular address
      my $result = $sender->send_sms(
            text => 'This is a test message',
            to   => '+61 4 1234 5678',
            );

    The "send_sms" method sends a standard text SMS message to a destination
    phone number.
